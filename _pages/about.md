We study problems at the intersection of data management and machine learning to build trustworthy and responsible decision-making systems. Our aim is to develop systems that enable explainability, fairness, and accountability of data-driven decision-making systems. We are particularly interested in:

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Explaining and debugging fairness violations in machine learning models and data science pipelines:</b> 
        <ul>
            <li>How can we determine sources of unexpected errors and bias in machine learning model outcomes?</li>
            <li>How can we decompose unexpected or discriminatory behavior of data science pipelines in terms of the different pipeline stages?</li>
            <li>Can we effectively generate post hoc explanations for the outcomes of machine learning models?</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Data integration and data quality:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>How can we leverage expert feedback to improve data cleaning techniques for machine learning?</li>
            <li>Can we use the final outcomes in data science pipelines to inform intermediate pipeline choices?</li> 
            <li>How can we intertwine pipeline stages with downstream analytics to improve upon the end goals? </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
